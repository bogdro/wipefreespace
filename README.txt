Author: Bogdan Drozdowski, bogdandr @ op . pl
License: GPLv2

Requirements:
- a gcc-compatible C compiler
- development package for the ext2 file system (usually something like
  e2fsprogs-devel).
- the 'make' program (you may however compile it by hand, if you wish)

Type 'make' to compile the program.

Type 'make doc' to compile the info documentation. This requires the
 'makeinfo' program (usually comes in a 'texinfo' package) and the texinfo.tex
 file (usually comes in a TeX package, like 'tetex').
