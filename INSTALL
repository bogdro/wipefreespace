Wipefreespace - a program for secure cleaning of free space on filesystems.

Requirements for compiling the full version:

- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.

- a working C compiler. XFS, ReiserFS, Reiser4 and NTFS support require the
  'long long' data type. NTFS support may require the gcc compiler.

- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
  XFS support requires the following headers: unistd.h, fcntl.h, mntent.h
  (but sys/wait.h, sched.h and paths.h can be useful, too) and the following
  functions: fork(), execvp(), dup2(), close(), pipe(), kill() and
  waitpid() or wait() (sleep() can be useful, too).

- the 'make' program

- Ext2/3/4: development package for the ext2 file system library, libext2fs
  (usually included in something like e2fsprogs-devel). If you don't have
  anything like this installed or available (check twice), then go to
  	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/
  Then compile and install that package. Ext4 support requires new versions,
  like 1.41.

- NTFS: development package for the NTFS file system library, libntfs (usually
  included in something like ntfsprogs-devel). If you don't have anything
  like this installed or available (check twice), then go to
  	http://www.linux-ntfs.org/
  Then compile and install that package.

- XFS: xfsprogs installed and in your PATH variable, if you want XFS support.
  Get these at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/

- ReiserFSv3: development package for reiserfsprogs (header files and
  compiled static libraries from the package). ReiserFS requires either the
  fork() function (unistd.h) and one of the waitpid(), wait() functions
  (sys/wait.h), the mntent.h header file (with at least one of its functions
  - getmntent() or getmntent_r()).

- Reiser4: development package for reiser4progs, libuuid (e2fsprogs or
  e2fsprogs-libs), libaal and the mntent.h header file. Go to
  	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/reiser4/
  and
  	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/
  to get the libraries. After installing, libmisc.a needs to be copied
  in the same place as libreiser4.a, but under a different name,
  libreiser4misc.a:

  cp reiser4progs-XX/libmisc/.libs/libmisc.a /dst/path/libreiser4misc.a

  Libmisc.a is in reiser4progs, of course. Nobody thought it would be
  needed, but libreiser4.a is useless without it.

- FAT12/16/32: tffs-lib, the Tiny FAT FS library. Go to
	http://code.google.com/p/tffs-lib/
  to get the library. After compiling, install the library and ALL its
  header files (including the private ones, from the src directory).

WARNING: If both ReiserFSv3 and ReiserFSv4 are enabled, the program may
 refuse to link if the compiler doesn't support the command line option
 "-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs" that makes the linker accept multiple symbol
 definitions. If you have this problem, disable the support for either
 of these filesystems (you can compile two versions of the program).
 Don't complain to me, complain to the guys that made reiserfsprogs and
 reiser4progs. You can fix either of these libraries yourself, by running
	find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/misc_mntent/new_misc_mntent/g' '{}' \;
 in the root directory of either reiserfsprogs or reiser4progs (but
 NOT both, because this would bring back the same problem, but with a
 different name). Type the command as above. The command must be run
 BEFORE compiling the reiserfs programs.

Type './configure' to configure the program for your system.  If you do not
wish support for a filesystem, give the '--enable-FS=no' option to ./configure
(FS=EXT234, NTFS, XFS, REISERFS, REISER4, FAT). Run './configure --help'
for details.

Type 'make' to compile the program.
Documentation will be compiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program
 ('texinfo' package).
Translations will be compiled, if you have the 'gettext' package.

Type 'make install' to install the program.

Type 'info wipefreespace' (or 'info doc/wipefreespace.info' befor install)
 to get help.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package:

1) copy the wipefreespace.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package wipefreespace-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/wipefreespace.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
