Wipefreespace - a program for secure cleaning of free space on filesystems.

Requirements for compiling the full version:
- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.
- a working C compiler
- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
- development package for the ext2 file system library, libext2fs (usually
  included in something like e2fsprogs-devel). If you don't have anything
  like this installed or available (check twice), then go to
  	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/
  Then compile and install that package.
- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the program for your system.

Type 'make' to compile the program.
Documentation will be compiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program
 ('texinfo' package).
Translations will be compiled, if you have the 'gettext' package.

Type 'make install' to install the program.
