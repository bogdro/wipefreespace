Requirements for compiling the full version:

- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.

- a working C compiler. XFS and NTFS support require the 'long long'
  data type.

- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
  XFS support reuires the following headers: unistd.h, fcntl.h, mntent.h
  (but sys/wait.h, sched.h and paths.h can be useful, too) and the following
  functions: fork(), execvp(), dup2(), close(), pipe() and one of waitpid(),
  wait() or kill() (sleep() can be useful, too).

- development package for the ext2 file system library, libext2fs (usually
  included in something like e2fsprogs-devel). If you don't have anything
  like this installed or available (check twice), then go to
  	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/
  Then compile and install that package.

- development package for the NTFS file system library, libntfs (usually
  included in something like ntfsprogs-devel). If you don't have anything
  like this installed or available (check twice), then go to
  	http://www.linux-ntfs.org/
  Then compile and install that package.

- the 'make' program

- xfsprogs installed and in your PATH variable, if you want XFS support.
  Get these at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/

Type './configure' to configure the program for your system.

Type 'make' to compile the program.
Documentation will be compiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program
 ('texinfo' package).
Translations will be compiled, if you have the 'gettext' package.

Type 'make install' to install the program.

Type 'info wipefreespace' to get help.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package:

1) copy the wipefreespace.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package wipefreespace-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/wipefreespace.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS

=======================================================

Translating the docs to your language:

 Type `msginit -i wipefreespace.pot -o XX.po', substituting your
2-letter language code for 'XX' (e.g. 'pl' or 'de'). This requires the
'gettext' package installed. You can manually copy the file
e2wipefreespace.pot to XX.po and manually add the following header, if
you wish.
 In the resulting XX.po file you have to fill in all the fields
marked with capital letters in the header:

The rest of the file will contain messages from the program. Translate
them all and send me the resulting XX.po file.

Translating the documentation:
- info: simply change the wipefreespace.texi file
- man: Unpack the page using @command{gunzip wipefreespace.1.gz} and
  translate the resulting wipefreespace.1 file.
