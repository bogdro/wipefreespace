	* Version 0.7
	  More GNU Coding Style ('info standards'). More enum using.
	  Operating buffer is now local to each function, not global.
	* wipefreespace.c: new option: --background. Including copyright
	  info for used libraries. More portable signal checking. Typo fixed.
	  Ignoring empty arguments. Environment not cleared anymore (required
	  for XFS support).
	* wipefreespace.h: new enum entry CURR_NONE instead of using a zero
	  all the time.
	* wfs_ntfs.c (destroy_record): wiping deleted files' name's length
	  and data length (it won't be posiible to tell how long was the
	  file name and how much data was inside).
	* info doc: new option added. Full texts of the Licenses added. Added
	  a note saying that signal handling needs 'volatile' to work. Added
	  what to do if compiling fails. Added the SIGCHLD signal. Added XFS
	  info in compiling requirements. Added a chapter about filesystem
	  support.
	* ext23.c (e2_count_blocks): using parameters instead of globals.
	* ext23.c (e2_wipe_unrm_dir): zeroing deleted files' name's length.
	* configure.ac: Better portability.
	* wfs_ntfs.c: Memory leak fixed. Better parameters checking. Better
	  error handling.
	* wfs_signal.{c,h}: New files for signal-related stuff. Catching
	  (and ignoring) SIGCHLD.
	* wfs_ntfs.c, ext23.c: Sync() now only run in *_flush() functions.
	  Better parameters checking.
	* wfs_xfs.{c,h}: XFS filesystem support based on xfsprogs. Only free
	  space wiping is supported (no development library).
	* wrappers.c: ensuring an error code is set (not only by returning
	  values), when an error occurred.
	* README: added XFS info, some minor corrections.

	* Version 0.6
	  Switch to autoconf+automake. Works great. Project rename
	  to 'wipefreespace'.
	* wipefreespace.c: Security: dropping capabilities and clearing
	  environment. Better error/message displaying routines.
	* secure.c: New file containing all security-related stuff.
	* wrappers.c: Fully filesystem-neutral. Better mount checking.
	* wipefreespace.h: New error_type definition. Less externs.
	* ext23.c: Flushing corrected and it shows error just once.
	* wfs_ntfs.{c,h}: NTFS support based on ntfsprogs, thus experimental.

2007-04-31	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.5
	  Code rebuild: separate 3 source files (+headers), to allow
	  other file systems in the future. Info doc update. Man page.
	* e2wipefreespace.c:
	  Security fixes: setuid bit checking and snprintf(). Return
	  codes slightly changed. Translations enabled
	  (gettext)+Polish translation. Separate message printing
	  functions (easy changeable).
	* Makefile: updated with translation & manpage.
	* ext23.c (e2wipe_unrm_dir): corrected: "name_len & 255".

2007-04-10	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.4
	  Finding last partially used buffer only if needed. More code
	  changes & cleanup. Added sync()ing after every writing,
	  if available. Three new options: --nopart, --nounrm, --nowfs.
	  Docs updated with signal information. Removing deleted files'
	  names fully works. Some Makefile updates - easy building RPMs.
	  Signals corrected and checked more often. Security: checking
	  stdout & stdin.

2007-04-08	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* Version 0.3
	  Various security fixes (checking of argc&argv and a safer
	  signal handler). New option --force makes the program continue
	  even if the file system contains errors. Separate function for
	  wiping blocks. Doc comments. Small code cleanup. Makefile upgrade
	  with the 'static' target and more warning options. More file
	  system checking. Wiping free space in partially used blocks.
	  Documentation (README & info) update. Includes compiled gzipped
	  'info' documentation. Block wiping corrected (flushing added).
	  Flushing verbose messages - in case of crashes the last message
	  shown is important for tracking.

	* Version 0.2
	  Adds generating the error table. Adds flushing the file system
	  before starting if it's marked dirty or invalid. Adds a second
	  try for opening the file system, when exclusive access is
	  impossible. Adds a 'verbose' option. Makefile fixed.

2007-03-24	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* First release of e2wipefreespace, version 0.1.
	  Uses exclusive access, if possible. Checks if the file system is
	  mounted. Uses raw block access, no i-nodes. Uses patterns from
	  'shred', but has own random-generating code. Sets signal handlers.
	  Accepts 7 command-line options, 'license' being an alias for
	  'licence'.
