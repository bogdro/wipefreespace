@chapter What is wipefreespace?

This program is used for secure erasing of free space on ext2, ext3, ext4, NTFS, XFS,
ReiserFSv3, ReiserFSv4, FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, MinixFSv1, MinixFSv2, JFS and HFS+ partitions.

Normally, when you delete a file, only the information about where the file was is
deleted, the file contents stays on the drive. If there's no writing to that
area, the file can physically stay on the drive for a long time. The file contents
can be found by e.g. dumping the whole drive with the @command{dd} program to a file
and looking at the
generated image. This may seem not so dangerous, but if you delete confidential information
(files with passwords, credit card numbers, encryption keys), any person with phyical access
to the drive can read that information and use it against you.

ALWAYS USE THE @command{shred} (or similar) PROGRAM TO ERASE CONFIDENTIAL DATA.

Sometimes you may delete confidential data
the normal way by accident (or have no other choice). In such case normally you would have
to shred the
whole partition, which may be a big problem. This is where @command{wipefreespace} comes in.
This program works in a similar way to the @command{shred} program, but instead of shreding
regular files,
it overwrites (just like @command{shred}) the free space on a partition, hopefully without
doing any harm to existing files. The wiped blocks are @strong{NOT} marked as used at any stage.

This program also tries to wipe the remaining space in blocks partially used by existing files and
wipe deleted elements' names.

THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN TESTED, BUT IT MAY NOW OR LATER CONTAIN ERRORS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO DATA LOSS.
ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM. READ THE LICENSE FOR A WARRANTY (THERE IS NONE).

@strong{NOTE}: The program will refuse operating if it finds out that it has the suid permission
bit set and the owner is root. PLEASE, NEVER do such a thing. If the program is exploited,
it can do severe damage to the system. Log in as root and run the program. If you really
must run the program as a normal user, set the sgid bit instead and correct the necessary
device/file permissions. This is MUCH safer.

@chapter How to compile the program?

Requirements for compiling the full version of the program:@*
@itemize
@item a non-root account. Please, @strong{NEVER} compile or 'make' anything as root.
@item a working C compiler (with the 'long long' data type for XFS, NTFS, ReiserFSv3
and Reiser4 support)
@item development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers).
@*@*


XFS support requires the following headers:@*@*
@itemize
@item unistd.h
@item fcntl.h
@item mntent.h
@item wait.h or sys/wait.h (not required, acutally, but a good thing to have)
@item sched.h (not required, acutally, but a good thing to have)
@item paths.h (not required, acutally, but a good thing to have)
@end itemize
@*
and the following functions:@*@*
@itemize
@item fork()
@item execvp()
@item dup2()
@item close()
@item pipe()
@item kill()
@item waitpid() or wait()
@item sleep() (not required, acutally, but a good thing to have)
@end itemize
@*
ReiserFSv3 support requires the following headers:@*@*
@itemize
@item unistd.h with wait.h or sys/wait.h
@item mntent.h (with at least one of its functions - getmntent() or getmntent_r())
@end itemize
@*
and the following functions:@*@*
@itemize
@item fork()
@item one of: waitpid() or wait()
@end itemize
@*
ReiserFSv4 support requires the following headers:@*@*
@itemize
@item mntent.h (with at least one of its functions - getmntent() or getmntent_r())
@end itemize
@*
@item the 'make' program
@end itemize
@*

You'll also need at least one of the following filesystem packages:

@itemize

@item Ext2/3/4: development package for the ext2 file system library, libext2fs (usually
included in something like e2fsprogs-devel). If you don't have anything
like this installed or available (check twice), then go to@*
   	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/@*
Then compile and install that package. Ext4 support requires new versions, like 1.41.

@item NTFS: development package for the NTFS file system library, libntfs (usually
included in something like ntfsprogs-devel). If you don't have anything
like this installed or available (check twice), then go to@*
   	http://www.linux-ntfs.org/@*
Then compile and install that package.

@item XFS: xfsprogs installed and in your PATH variable (devel package unusable, so
not required). Can be downloaded from@*
	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/@*@*
Compile and install that package. The following utilities should be available:
xfs_db, xfs_freeze, xfs_unfreeze. The xfs_db program should support the following
command-line options: "-i", "-c" and the following interactive mode commands:
"quit", "freesp -d", "blockget -n", "ncheck", "sb 0", "print". Version 2.7.11 is
enough, earlier versions will probably also work.

@item ReiserFSv3: development package for the ReiserFSv3 file system library (usually
included in something like reiserfsprogs-devel. If not available, copy the
headers and the library from reiserfsprogs after compiling them).

@item Reiser4: development package for reiser4progs, libuuid (e2fsprogs or
e2fsprogs-libs) and libaal. Go to@*
  	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/reiser4/@*@*
and@*
  	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/@*@*
to get the libraries. After installing, libmisc.a needs to
be copied in the same place as libreiser4.a, but under a different name -
libreiser4misc.a:

  cp libmisc/.libs/libmisc.a /usr/lib/libreiser4misc.a

Libmisc.a is in reiser4progs, of course. Nobody thought it would be
needed, but libreiser4.a is useless without it. Substitute the correct destination
path for your system in the above command.

@item FAT12/16/32: tffs-lib, the Tiny FAT FS library. Go to@*
	http://code.google.com/p/tffs-lib/@*
to get the library. After compiling, install the library and ALL its
header files (including the private ones, from the src directory).

@item MinixFS: "mfstool", the MinixFS tool. Go to@*
	http://mfstool.sourceforge.net/@*
to get this program. Before compiling, perform:@*
  	sed -i 's/opt_squash/0/g' `ls *.c | egrep -v main`@*
then compile the program (./configure && make), then perform@*
  	ar surf libminixfs.a `ls *.o | egrep -v main`.@*
Then copy the files libminixfs.a, minix_fs.h and protos.h to a directory
where the C compiler can find them (or put the correct -I and -L options
in the compiler flags). You can use the provided patches to do this
instead of the sed command:@*
@command{patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/mfstool-0.5.diff}


@item JFS: jfsutils and libuuid (the <uuid/uuid.h> header file). Go to@*
	http://jfs.sourceforge.net/@*
to get jfsutils. Libuuid can be a part of "util-linux-ng", which can be
found on the kernel site:@*
	ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/@*
or as a part of e2fsprogs available at@*
  	http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/.@*

Compile jfsutils, then copy all the jfs_*.h header files from the
"include" subdirectory and the libfs.a file to a directory where the
C compiler can find them (or put the correct -I and -L options in the
compiler flags).

@item HFS+: the "hfsplus" package. Go to@*
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/hfsplus_1.0.4.orig.tar.gz@*
to get it. Before compiling, apply the patch:@*
	patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/hfsplus-1.0.4.diff@*
After compiling, install all the libraries and ALL the header files
from the libhfsp/src/ directory where the C compiler can find them (or
put the correct -I and -L options in the compiler flags).

@end itemize

@strong{WARNING}: If both ReiserFSv3 and ReiserFSv4 are enabled, the program may
refuse to link if the compiler doesn't support the command line option
"-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs" that makes the linker accept multiple symbol definitions. If
you have this problem, disable the support for either of these filesystems
(you can compile two versions of the program).
Don't complain to me, complain to the guys that made reiserfsprogs and
reiser4progs.@*
You can fix either of these libraries yourself, by running
@*@*
@command{find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/misc_mntent/new_misc_mntent/g' '@{@}' \;}@*
@*@*
in the root directory of either reiserfsprogs or reiser4progs (but
@strong{NOT} both, because this would bring back the same problem, but with a
different name). Type the command as above, just without the leading and trailing
apostrophes. The command must be run @strong{BEFORE} compiling the reiserfs programs.
You can use the provided patches to do this:@*
@command{patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff}
@command{patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser4-1.0.7.diff}

@strong{WARNING}: If both ReiserFSv3 and MinixFS are enabled, the program

@command{find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/bread/new_bread/g' '@{@}' \;}
@*@*
in the root directory of either reiserfsprogs or jfsutils (but

@command{patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff}@*

Even if your linker/compiler accepts the "-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs" option, it
 won't help in this case.

The patches for ntfsprogs are optional. Whether or not they will be included
in the official release of ntfsprogs, wipefreespace still will compile.

Type './configure' to configure the program for your system.

If you do not wish support for a filesystem, give the @option{--enable-FS=no}
option to ./configure (FS=EXT234, NTFS, XFS, REISERFS, REISER4, FAT,
MINIX, JFS, HFSP).

If you do not wish support for a particular wiping operation, give the
@option{--enable-OPER=no} option to ./configure (OPER=wfs, unrm, part - these
are wiping free space, undelete data and partially-used blocks,
respectively). You cannot disable all of these.

Run @command{./configure --help} for details.

Type 'make' to compile the program.
Documentation is compiled, but may be recompiled, if you have the 'makeinfo'
program ('texinfo' package).
Translations will be compiled, if you have the 'gettext' package.

@strong{NOTE}: if you have trouble compiling, send me some of the first error messages
in each file and the config.h file generated by the @command{configure} script.

Type 'make install' to install the program.

@strong{NOTE}: 'make install' is NOT recommended. Create and install an rpm package instead,
if possible.

To create an RPM package:@*
@enumerate
@item copy the wipefreespace.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
@item copy the source package wipefreespace-@VERSION@.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
@item type @command{rpmbuild -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/wipefreespace.spec}
@item get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386
@end enumerate

@strong{NOTE}: some systems may use other directories than these.

To create an RPM package (the new way):

@enumerate
@item copy the wipefreespace.spec file to $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
@item copy the source package wipefreespace-@VERSION@.tar.gz to $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
@item type @command{rpmbuild -bb $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/wipefreespace.spec}
@item get the rpms from $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386

@section Command line syntax and options

Basic syntax is:

 wipefreespace [options] /dev/XY [...]

The '/dev/XY' part stands for a device with a supported file system. Examples: /dev/hda1, /dev/fd0.
More than one device can be given on the command line, but they will be wiped sequentially,
@strong{NOT} in multiple threads. WipeFreeSpace is not multi-threaded and probably won't be,
because the libraries used can be not thread-safe and the program can't tell if a library will
be used until it's used.

Each given filesystem is wiped @strong{ONLY ONCE}, no matter how many times
it appears on the command line.

WipeFreeSpace also works for file systems created inside regular files on any host file system.

@strong{NOTE}: It is best to use this program on un-mounted file systems,
which makes sure the journal is committed.

@strong{NOTE}: If a block is damaged, it is only wiped until the first error. There is
no guarantee that it will be fully wiped.

Options:

@noindent @option{--all-zeros}@*
@quotation
Use only zeros for wiping.
@end quotation

@noindent @option{--background}@*

@chapter Return values

The wipefreespace program can return any of the following values:

@itemize
@item 0: All actions on the last file system succeded (no errors).
@item 1: Only version number, help or licence information was requested and printed, no action.
@item -1: Bad/missing command line syntax.
@item -2: Unable to check if the file system is mounted. Cannot continue.
@item -3: The file system was mounted in read-write mode. Cannot continue.
@item -4: Unable to open the file system.
@item -5: Unable to read block bitmap from the file system (thus, unable to determine, which
blocks are unused).
@item -6: Memory allocation failed.
@item -7: The file system contained errors and the option @option{--force} was not given.
@item -8: Closing the file system failed.
@item -9: Opening i-node scan failed. Thus, the program was unable to wipe free space in
partially used blocks.
@item -10: Iterating over blocks failed. Thus, the program was unable to wipe free space in
partially used blocks.
@item -11: I-node read failed. Some undelete data may not have been removed.
@item -12: Directory iterating failed. Thus, the program was unable to remove some of (maybe all)
undelete data.
@item -13: The program found out that it has the suid permission bit set and the owner
is root. Read the first chapter of this documentation for an explanation and a solution.
@item -14: Flushing the changes to the filesystem failed.
@item -15: Block writing failed.
@item -16: Failed to open an attribute (mostly on NTFS).
@item -17: Failed runlist on NTFS.
@item -18: Getting name failed.
@item -19: Context error (NTFS).
@item -20: Bad parameter was passed to one of the functions.
@item -21: Pipe error (mostly XFS).
@item -22: Fork error (XFS or ReiserFSv3).
@item -23: Exec error (XFS).
@item -24: Seek error (mostly ReiserFSv4).
@item -25: Block reading failed.
@item -100: A signal was caught and the program was forced to exit.
@item 128+N: The program was terminated by signal number N (the signal either wasn't caught
or was caught after SIGCONT was received).
@end itemize

@strong{NOTE}: Actually, the negative values are substracted from 256,
so -1 could turn up as 255, -2 as 254 and so on.

@strong{NOTE}: The error code is reset after each file system. If the last file system was wiped successfully,
but the previous weren't, their errors are currently lost.


@c ==================================================================



@node Signals, Author, Return values, Top
@comment  node-name, next,      previous,  up
@chapter Signals

The program will terminate normally (that is: will flush and close the file system and
release memory) if any of the following signals (if available during compiling)
are caught: SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGQUIT, SIGILL,
SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGTTIN,
SIGTTOU, SIGBUS, SIGPOLL, SIGPROF, SIGSYS, SIGTRAP, SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ, SIGPWR, SIGVTALRM,
SIGUNUSED, SIGEMT, SIGLOST.

The SIGCHLD (required for XFS support) signal is caught, but ignored.

If the program receives the SIGKILL signal, it will, of course, be killed. But it
won't be able to close the file system and finish working normally. The file system
being worked on
could be left in an unconsistent state, errors could show up.
Try to avoid stopping the program this way.

You can freeze the program by sending the SIGSTOP signal (like @command{killall -STOP wipefreespace})
to it or by pressing Ctrl+Z in the terminal on which the program is running. The program will
continue if it receives the SIGCONT signal (like with @command{killall -CONT wipefreespace}).
You can still send other signals to it, if you wish to terminate it.

@strong{NOTE}: for signal handling to work, your compiler probably needs a working 'volatile'
data type. If you are using GCC, no worries.

@heading Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@heading TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

@iftex
@heading NO WARRANTY
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@center NO WARRANTY

@item
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

@item
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

@heading Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) @var{yyyy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) @var{year} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@example
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end example

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document @dfn{free} in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

@item
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
@sc{ascii} without markup, Texinfo input format, La@TeX{} input
format, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} using a publicly available
@acronym{DTD}, and standard-conforming simple @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include @acronym{PNG}, @acronym{XCF} and
@acronym{JPG}.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, @acronym{SGML} or
@acronym{XML} for which the @acronym{DTD} and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

@item
VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

@item
COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

@item
MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

@enumerate A
@item
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

@item
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

@item
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

@item
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

@item
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

@item
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

@item
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

@item
Include an unaltered copy of this License.

@item
Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

@item
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

@item
For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

@item
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

@item
Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

@item
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

@item
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
@end enumerate

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

@item
COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all
sections Entitled ``Endorsements.''

@item
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

@item
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

@item
TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

@item
TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

@page
@heading ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

@smallexample
@group
  Copyright (C)  @var{year}  @var{your name}.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with@dots{}Texts.'' line with this:

@smallexample
@group
    with the Invariant Sections being @var{list their titles}, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being @var{list}, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being @var{list}.
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

Type @command{msginit -i wipefreespace.pot -o XX.po}, substituting your
2-letter language code for 'XX' (e.g. 'pl' or 'de'). This requires the 'gettext'
package installed. You can manually copy the file wipefreespace.pot to XX.po and
manually add the following header, if you wish.@*
In the resulting XX.po file you have to fill in all the fields
marked with capital letters in the header:
